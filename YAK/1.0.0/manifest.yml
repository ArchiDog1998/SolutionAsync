description: >
  Make Grasshopper UI responsible during the solution. On the other hand, the document's solution state will never be process! That's the loss.
  
  
  You can change level to make the solution's order much better, which can save your time. And the preview will refresh when solution down.
  
  
  1.0.0 Notes:
  
  1. Fix the bug that index out of range.
  
  2. Fixed the bug caused by using async state transitions while computing.
